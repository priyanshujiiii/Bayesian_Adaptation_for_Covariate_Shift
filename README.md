# Training on Test Data with Bayesian Adaptation for Covariate Shift

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

This project reimplements the key ideas from the paper:

> **Training on Test Data with Bayesian Adaptation for Covariate Shift**  
> [NeurIPS 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12746) â€” *Aurick Zhou, Sergey Levine*

The goal is to improve model performance under **distribution shifts** at test time, using a **Bayesian adaptation** framework. Instead of training a model to handle all possible shifts, this approach adapts to the specific test-time data using **unlabeled inputs** via **entropy minimization**.

---

## ðŸ§  Core Idea

- At test time, the model sees inputs from a different distribution.
- The method uses **Bayesian reasoning** to adapt the model to the test data without needing labels.
- This is achieved through a **regularized entropy minimization** process.
- Leads to better **accuracy** and **uncertainty estimation** on shifted data.
